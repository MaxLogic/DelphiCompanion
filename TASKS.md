### T-008 Add copy path modes to Problems dialog
Summary: Provide selectable copy path formats (full/repo-relative/project-relative, Windows/WSL) and persist the selection.

### T-001 Open units in source view
Summary: Ensure the units picker opens the .pas source editor instead of the form designer.

### T-002 Avoid project-group merges on open
Summary: When opening a project or group that is not part of the current group, close the current group first.

### T-003 Make picker shortcuts global
Summary: Ensure the projects picker shortcut works anywhere and the units picker shortcut works when a project is open.

### T-004 Harden Problems dialog jump-to-code
Summary: Ensure the Problems dialog consistently focuses the code editor and places the cursor on the reported line.

### T-005 Make Problems dialog shortcut global
Summary: Ensure the Problems dialog shortcut works from any IDE pane and focuses the editor after jumps.

### T-006 Fix Problems dialog column jumps
Summary: Convert character columns from build/error insight into editor columns so jumps land on the correct position, even with tabs.

### T-007 Copy Problems items
Summary: Allow copying selected Problems dialog entries to the clipboard (Ctrl+C) in an AI-friendly format.
